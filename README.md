## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Cloudinary account for image uploads.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/vaibhavvatsbhartiya/School-Management-System-API.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file and add the following:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGO_URI= your mongo URI
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
   CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=your_chosen_time_for_token_to_expires
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start or npm run dev
